# rosu-pp-py

Difficulty and performance calculation for all [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) modes.

This is a python binding to the Rust library [rosu-pp](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) which was bootstrapped through [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/PyO3).
Since all the heavy lifting is done by Rust, rosu-pp-py comes with a very fast performance.
Check out rosu-pp's README for more info.

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/xxdstem/rosu-pp-py
```
